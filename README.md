Variational Deep Embedding with mnist

**Notice**
==========
My best accuracy is 90.55%, a bit lower than the accuracy in the paper.


My experiment shows that initialization for variables and the pretraining process have a great influence on the final result. What's more, the variance of the result is quite big. It is not that easy to get an 90%+ accuracy for my code.
